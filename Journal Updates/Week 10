Our robot this week has undergone a series of cosmetic changes, as well as some practical physical ones.
The main difference in the chassis was the introduction of solid black panels as well as a few metal connecting posts for the sides.
This can be found in github marked under Robot V5, and V5 Above. 
This change in body, which was inspired heavily from Jonathan's Minibot, also resulted in a reduced form factor. 
This was taken another step further when the size of the claws and forward body were shrunk down.  

We adjusted the design of our claws, and its primary guide located on the underside of the front chassis, in order to combat a violent shaking that was present in the micro servos. 
Having made new design changes, including limiting the length of the arms, we have opted to replace the worn micro servos in exchange for newer versions. 

We also will be updating our captured block function soon, as our minimum distance has decreased due to our new body design. 

The differences in our navigation this week came with the implementation of the magnetometer into our mini bot navigation experiments. 
This was to derive our directional impulses from a sense of cardinal directional movement , rather than using cues from sensor impulses from quadrant tape. 
This experiment took up the entirety of our time on Tuesday but has still proved inconsistent as a replacement for our adjusted idea of correctional movement.
It has not moved on to  be in our official main code body.
